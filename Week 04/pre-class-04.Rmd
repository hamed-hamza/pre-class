### Question 1:

Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50. 
```{r}
for(i in 1:50) {print(i)}
```

### Question 2:

A.  Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.
```{r}
j <- 0
for(i in 0:1000) {j <- j +i}
j
```

B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())
```{r}
j <- 0
for(i in seq(0, 1000, 2)) {j <- j + i}
j
```

C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.
```{r}
sum(0:1000)

```

### Question 3:

Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.
```{r}
survey.clean <- survey

for(i in 2:ncol(survey.clean)) {
  
 data.temp <- survey.clean[,i]
 
 data.temp[(data.temp %in% 1:5) == F] <- NA
 
 survey.clean[,i] <- data.temp
 
}

survey.clean
```

B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.
```{r}
survey.clean$invalid.answers <- NA

for(row.i in 1:nrow(survey.clean)) 
{data.temp <- survey.clean[row.i,]
n.na <- sum(is.na(data.temp)) - 1 
survey.clean$invalid.answers[row.i] <- n.na}
survey.clean
```
